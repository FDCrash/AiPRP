    <h2>Sniper rifle</h2>

    <p>A sniper rifle is a high-precision rifle designed for sniper missions. It serves to fulfil the tactical need for
        long range surveillance, effective anti-personnel and anti-materiel operations with high hit efficiency, and can
        be used by both military, law enforcement and civilian militias. The modern sniper rifle is a portable
        shoulder-fired weapon system with a choice between bolt-action or semi-automatic action, fitted with a
        telescopic sight for extreme accuracy and chambered for a high-ballistic performance centerfire cartridge.</p>
